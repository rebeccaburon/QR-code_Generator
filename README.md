# QR-code_Generator
 The repository contains backend + frontend to generate a QR-code for specific IDs

## Project Overview
This project is developed as part of my **final exam project** in the Computer Science (Datamatiker) program.  
The goal is to design and implement a **demonstration module** for the CERoS platform, enabling:

- Generation of QR codes for laboratory samples
- Printing QR labels for physical attachment to samples
- Scanning of QR codes via a work mobile device
- Automatic retrieval of related sample data and status information

The module consists of both **backend** and **frontend** components.
